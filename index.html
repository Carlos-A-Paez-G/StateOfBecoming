       <h3>Spring 2025 Performance Co//ective Showcase</h3>

       <h3>Director's Note</h3>
       <p>
        It is with pleasure we present ‘state of becoming’ as the culmination 
        of eight weeks of collective creating, exploring, and community building. 
        We began with the fundamental belief that art making and art sharing is 
        transformational to the givers and the receivers, the makers and the takers, 
        the performers and the audience.  
        </p>
        <p>
            As you experience the ‘state of becoming’ take a pause and recognize 
            that we are not giving you a story in linear form. There are moments 
            that beg you to deeply feel it all, or in opposition, release and take 
            a breath of fresh air. There are interactions that give away something 
            that we don’t actually have, that seek to know emptiness. This 
            emptiness sometimes is heavy like baggage, like wood,  like earth, 
            or sand, or clay. We simply surrender to it. Other times the state of 
            becoming is a witness to our brokenness and seeks to mend our broken 
            pieces. We ask, can we be willing to open ourselves and see it as beauty, 
            even if it is not pretty?  If we can, perhaps we may feel light, unbearably 
            light.  It is hard to remember how light. We might even realize later, we 
            forgot what we put ourselves through in order to become who we are. Shall 
            we let it out? Shall we keep it in?
        </p>
        <p>
            This process, and ultimately this performance, is not a quest to 
            identify what we become when we perform. The performers are performing 
            themselves, there are no characters here. Instead, we are asking the 
            question,  “what does it mean to be willing to change, and in the 
            moment of transformation, are we willing to open up to those possibilities 
            and vulnerabilities in order to face the unknown? It is a question of 
            how, not what.  
        </p>
        <p>
            We hope you can find something you can hold on to, something to 
            let go of, something to think about later. Maybe tonight, or next 
            week, or five years from now.  state of becoming.

       <h3>About Performance Co/lab and Performance Co//ective</h3>
       <p>In August 2023, the first Performance Co/lab took place at 421 
        Art Campus. Facilitated by Carlos Páez González and Mary Chase, 
        with a focus on specific values of inclusivity, openness in participation, 
        care, and growth, this was a workshop that ran with the primary intention 
        to bring performing artists in and around Abu Dhabi together into one space, 
        where we could share our collective knowledge and build collaboration. We take 
        an interdisciplinary approach to performance, blending approaches from 
        dance, theater, music, movement practice, writing, sound, and visual art. 
        Since then, Performance Co/lab has continued to be a recurring part of 421 
        Art Campus’ programing, </p>
        <p>
            Performance Co//ective was born out of a desire for 
            consistency. While Performance Co/labs are individual 
            workshops that allow anyone to join at any point, Performance 
            Co//ective is a selective program that aims to develop original 
            work that is unique to the cohort of artists. By engaging in 
            these longer processes, we create a stronger foundation for 
            collaboration and hope to set the scene for more developed 
            performance work to emerge from Abu Dhabi in the coming years.

        <h5>Carlos Páez González</h5>
        <p>
            Carlos is a multidisciplinary theater artist, game designer, 
            and educator. His work focuses on creating new realities where 
            audience-participants explore new ways of being themselves and 
            interacting with other humans and non-humans. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After a serendipitous acting workshop 13 years ago, Carlos has 
            been consistently performing, starting in Venezuela with the 
            Theater Group of the Corporate University Sigo, and then in Abu 
            Dhabi with Community Theater groups such as Resuscitation Theatre, 
            Beyond the Veil, and musical performance groups like the UAE 
            National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) and the acapella group Blue 
            Fever. Throughout his undergraduate studies, Carlos developed an 
            interdisciplinary practice that combined theatrical performance 
            with game design. The fruits of this exploration can be seen in 
            works such as After the Mountain Wildfires (The Everywhere Classroom), 
            presented at Dubai World Expo 2020 and produced by Alserkal Avenue, 
            which took inspiration from theories of instructional design to create a 
            live performance combining videogames, board games, and live performance, 
            where audiences interacted through game-like structures; and Dinos Rock!, 
            an interactive play for children aged 6 to 10. In recent years, Carlos 
            continues to be active in the Abu Dhabi performing arts scene, performing 
            with groups like the Abu Dhabi Choral Group in their production of 
            Sister Act, and the Public Art Abu Dhabi Biennial, where he performed 
            and coordinated for Bik Van Der Pol’s The Poem that Jumps the Fence and 
            Load Na Dito’s In Search of a Monument.

            and at The Junction and the lighting designer for Hamour Doesn’t 
            Leave the Cubicle. Carlos is currently the full time technician at 
            the theater in Raha International School Gardens Campus, which boasts

            presented as part of The Trace of Dawn, an online exhibition 
            by Header/Footer Gallery. Carlos also incorporates creative 
            coding into his performance, such as in the short performance 
            Salata, presented at Alserkal Avenue and produced by Engage 101, 
            where a live simulation would run in parallel to the live performance. 
            Carlos has also developed a short arcade-style videogame titled Clams, 
            using the “fantasy retro console” Pico-8.
        </p>

            As an educator, Carlos has conducted several arts workshops in 
            Abu Dhabi and Al Ruwais City for different age groups. Carlos 
            currently co-runs the Performance Co/Lab workshops at 421 Arts 
            Campus in collaboration with seasoned performer and producer Mary 
            Chase, which are recurring, free, open to all performance workshops
